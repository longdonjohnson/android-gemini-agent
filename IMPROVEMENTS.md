# 🎉 App Improvements - No API Key Needed at Build Time!

## What Changed

### 1. Runtime API Key Entry ✨
- **Before:** Had to set API key in `local.properties` before building
- **After:** App asks for API key on first use
- **Benefits:** 
  - Build APK without any configuration
  - Easy to share APK with others
  - Users enter their own API key
  - Can change API key anytime in the app

### 2. Build Notifications 📢
- **New:** `build-with-notifications.sh` uses termux-notification
- **Features:**
  - Live build progress in notifications
  - Vibration when build completes
  - Success/failure alerts
  - Build time tracking

## How It Works Now

### Building the APK

```bash
cd ~/android-gemini-agent
./build-with-notifications.sh
```

You'll see:
- ✅ Progress notifications during build
- ✅ Build status updates
- ✅ Completion notification with vibration
- ✅ APK size and build time

**No API key needed to build!**

### Using the App

1. **Install APK** on your device
2. **Open app** for first time
3. **Enable Accessibility Service**
4. **Enter a task** and tap "Start Agent"
5. **App will ask for API key** - enter it once
6. **Done!** - Key is saved for future use

### API Key Dialog

When you first start a task, you'll see:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│   Gemini API Key Required           │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤

│ [Enter your Gemini API key       ]  │
│                                     │
│       [Cancel]        [Save]        │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Build Scripts Available

### 1. `build-with-notifications.sh` (Recommended)
- Shows progress notifications
- Vibrates on completion
- Auto-copies to Downloads
- Detailed logging

### 2. `build-apk.sh` (Simple)
- Basic build without notifications
- Shows spinner in terminal
- Lighter weight

### 3. `push-to-github.sh` (Cloud Build)
- Builds on GitHub Actions
- No local resources used
- Download APK when ready

## Advantages

### For Developers
- ✅ No pre-build configuration
- ✅ Shareable APK (no secrets baked in)
- ✅ Easier testing
- ✅ GitHub Actions compatible

### For Users
- ✅ Enter their own API key
- ✅ Can change key anytime

## API Key Storage

- Stored in: `SharedPreferences`

- Can be cleared by uninstalling app

## Build Time Expectations

With notifications, you can track:
- **First build:** 10-20 minutes
- **Clean build:** 3-5 minutes
- **Incremental build:** 1-3 minutes

Notifications keep you updated throughout!

## Next Steps

1. **Build the APK:**
   ```bash
   cd ~/android-gemini-agent
   ./build-with-notifications.sh
   ```

2. **Watch for notifications** during build

3. **Install when ready** - APK will be in Downloads

4. **Enter API key** when you first use the app

That's it! No more pre-build configuration needed.
