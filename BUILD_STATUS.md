# 🔨 Build Status - ACTIVE

## Current Status: ✅ BUILDING

**Build started:** Just now  
**Wakelock:** ✅ Acquired (device won't sleep)  
**Notifications:** ✅ Enabled  
**Expected time:** 10-20 minutes

## What's Happening

The build is actively compiling your Android APK with these optimizations:

✅ **Fixed aapt2 Architecture Issue**
   - Using Termux's native ARM64 aapt2
   - No more x86_64 compatibility errors

✅ **Runtime API Key**
   - App will ask for key on first use
   - No build-time configuration needed

✅ **Wakelock Active**
   - Device won't sleep during build
   - Ensures build completes successfully

✅ **Notifications Enabled**
   - Check your notifications for progress
   - Vibration alert when complete

## Monitor Progress

### Check Build Status
```bash
cd ~/android-gemini-agent
./check-build.sh
```

### Watch Live Log
```bash
tail -f ~/android-gemini-agent/build.log
```

### Check Output
```bash
cat ~/android-gemini-agent/build-output.txt
```
